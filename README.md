# EEG-Creativity-Analysis

This MATLAB script computes alpha and beta power from EEG data collected during human creativity tasks (Idea Generation, Idea Development, Idea Evaluation). It also generates plots, computes repeated-measures ANOVA, and performs paired t-tests with effect sizes.

## How to use
1. Place all subject `.mat` EEG files in the same folder as `EEG_Creativity_Analysis.m`.
2. Open MATLAB and run `EEG_Creativity_Analysis.m`.
3. The script will output summary tables and plots for alpha/beta power analysis.
